  datasetDescription: "This dataset, generated by the Aittokallio Lab, includes harmonised genetic, molecular and epigenetic data, with comprehensive annotations, and standardised drug response assessment of the cell lines, representing major clinical T-cell lymphoma and leukemia (TCL) subtypes and capturing the molecular and phenotypic diversity of TCLs. This dataset supports investigations into TCL subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities linked to genetic and epignenetic features."
